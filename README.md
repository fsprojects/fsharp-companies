# fsharp-companies
Community curated list of companies that use F#

This list has been made in collaboration with members of [/r/fsharp](https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell)

There are similar lists for companies that use the following functional languages: 

1. [Haskell](https://github.com/erkmos/haskell-companies)
2. [PureScript](https://github.com/ajnsit/purescript-companies)

#### Updates
If you see a company on the list that doesn't exist anymore, or does not use Haskell anymore, please send a pull request with an explanation. The same goes if you're currently working at, or know a company that uses Haskell but is not on the list. Please include the website, github (if applicable), locations, sector and whether the company allows developers to work remotely.

Many of these companies have some kind of Haskell development, but it is often in one or a few particular teams rather than company-wide.

### Remote

Some of these companies support remote hires. Where that information is available, it has been indicated in the `Remote OK` column below. Timezone and/or country restrictions might apply.
